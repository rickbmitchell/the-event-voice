          <p>I come from a family of amazing storytellers.  We have a natural ability to capture peopleâ€™s attention and create an experience that is interesting and hilarious.  Trust me when I say, family gatherings are like comedy festivals.  This is the foundation of my success as a professional emcee today.</p>
          <p>My storytelling abilities were developed by some great teachers.  They taught me the benefits of pacing, timing and how to read an audience.  These skills created confidence on stage as a performing artist and emcee.</p>
          <p>For years, I have worked as a stand-up comic, musician, and actor.  The core of this work has been the development of my <i>voice</i> and how to use it for maximum effect.  Countless hours recording vocals for music, voiceovers and character work has given me intimate experience with the power and strengths of my voice and how it can be used to inspire an audience.</p>
